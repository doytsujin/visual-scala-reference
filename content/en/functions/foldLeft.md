# `foldLeft`

{{< signature >}}

`foldLeft` applies, going from left to right, the binary operator `op` to each element and the previous `op` result.
The first time `op` is applied it's fed with the initial value `z`.

On empty collections this function doesn't apply `op` and the initial value `z` is directly returned.
